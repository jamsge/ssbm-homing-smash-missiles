802b6a60 - function related to creating missile, r3 offset 0x2c -> missile enitity!
maybe when missile is spawned, store the memory address to it in a memalloc address (need up to 3)
create gobj with g_proc function using gobj_addproc. this process will check if there are missiles, and
if there are, change their position to make them home in on the enemy

need to check the free memory spot if the projectile belongs to the player



process:

80268B18 - spawn entity function, returns pointer to entity gobj in r3. 
Use 0x2c offset to get to entity data, store pointer to entity data

For entity data:
Check if it's a super missile (0x10 = offset for item type, should be 0x5F)
0x518 = offset for pointer to player entity data struct, 
0x2c in this struct points to player character data, 
then 0x0C should be player slot (0-indexed)

if player slot == 0, target becomes 1
if player slot == 1, target becomes 0

Static block starting at 0x80453080 for P1, 80453F10 for P2

from static block, 0x14 is nametage position y value
